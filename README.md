# Gas_simulation
Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed before running the simulation:

Python above 3.10

Required Python libraries:
pip install numpy matplotlib

How to Run

1.Clone or download the script.

2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.

3.Run the following command:
python gas_simulation.py

4.Adjust the sliders to see the simulation respond in real time.

How It Works

Particles move randomly inside a container.

Higher temperature increases their movement speed.

Changing the volume alters the container size.

Pressure Calculation:

Based on the relationship P ‚àù T / V.

The title of the simulation updates dynamically with the computed pressure.

T-V Graph:

Plots the current temperature and volume as a red dot.

Shows past values as a blue history trail.
